# Progressive Web Apps

Future of the apps. Use an app right from the browser, add to homescreen if you want. The browser is the new app store.

## Requirements

-  **HTTPS** - Content has to be loaded over HTTPS.
-  **Service Workers** - The app has to use a Service Worker in order to function offline.
-  **Manifest file** - Name, icons, splash screen, etc.

## Perks

- **Web Push Notifications** - The browser does not need to be open, because Service Workers can reply to requests.
