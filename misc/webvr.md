# WebVR

Implemented in FF Nightly, coming in Chrome 54. But there is the [webvr-polyfill](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill) - a JS library that works everywhere.

Simple Sphere photos and videos are already here - easily made with Cardboard Camera (for Android).

## A-Frame

HTML markup for creating WebVR.


## Responsive

It should work on non-VR devices by moving the cursor (desktop) or moving the device (mobile)
