## Wallet

is just a pair of keys - public is for others to send you BTC, private is for sending BTC to others.

Paper wallet - should be spent once, because of change, and anyway after using a computer to spend the coins make this paper wallet unsecure.

## Change

When spending from a wallet, the change is sent to a new wallet?
So paper wallets are tricky, always spend the full amount to a normal wallet, then from there send change to a new paper wallet.
Like in fiat money, you can't spend a part of a banknote.
So clients send the remainder of the transaction to the original wallet.

> When you come to use your paper wallet, empty it all into your live wallet then put the stuff you want kept safe into a new paper wallet.
