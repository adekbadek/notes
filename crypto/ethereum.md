# Ethereum

## The currency (token)

> Ether is a token whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum platform.
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum)

## The Platform

Apart from supporting (like Bitcoin blockchain) a cryptocurrency, Ethereum is also a distributed computing platform.

> The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum)

This means that just like a computer, EVM can run a program. This program cannot be turned off or manipulated with, because the code is stored in the blockchain.

## Smart Contracts

> Smart contracts are high-level programming abstractions that are compiled down to EVM bytecode and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain for execution.
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum)

The most popular language to write smart contracts in is [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io).

## Gas

Gas is payment for running the smart contract on the blockchain (running computations or storing data). It's paid by the account that initiates the transaction.

## Interacting with the smart contracts

- [web.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) "is a collection of libraries which allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node, using an HTTP, WebSocket or IPC connection."
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.github.io) browser extension can facilitate interacting with blockchain-based smart contract systems.

## Developing smart contracts

[Truffle framework](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) seems to be the go-to choice.
