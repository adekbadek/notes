# Functional programming

Using composable, pure functions. It makes the code reusable, less complex, and testable.

## Functions

A function is a value.

### Pure functions

  - do not have side effects (don't change anything outside of themselves, they are predictable)
  - return something
  - are deterministic (given the same input, return same output)
  - do not change objects passed as arguments - they return new objects

### Higher-order functions

either take functions as parameters, return functions, or both.

### Recursion

functions that call themselves, to avoid using mutable values

```elm
fib n =
  if n < 2 then
    1
  else
    fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)

List.map fib [0..8]
-- [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

### Lambda Calculus (Î»-calculus)

Is a system used to define functions.

In functional programming, functions also have a type. A function that squares a number takes type `integer` and returns also `integer`, so it's type is `Int -> Int`.

In Lambda Calculus, a function can take only one argument and return one value. So a function that takes multiple arguments is really a series of functions, and can be *partially applied* (code in Elm):

```elm
> adder a b = a + b
<function> : number -> number -> number
> adder 4 6
10 : number
> addTwo = adder 2
<function> : number -> number
> addTwo 5
7 : number
```

### Currying

translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that take one argument.  

### Point-free notation

the arguments of the function being defined are not explicitly mentioned, the function is defined through function composition

```elm
func1 value =
  (func2 << func3) value
```

can be written as

```elm
func1 =
  (func2 << func3)
```

## Values

### Immutablity

'Variables' are immutable (constant)

  - __just as in math__, `x = x + 1` is illegal
  - so it does not make sense to call them *variables*, they are sometimes called *symbols*

### Static typing

Type of a value cannot be changed. It limits errors (compiler can detect bugs), and makes code more readable.
