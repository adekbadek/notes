# Haskell

Is a purely functional, lazy, statically typed programming language.

- Purely functional - functions are values, values never change
- Lazy (*non-strict*) - value is not computed until it is actually needed

Haskell was developed patiently in academia, without the demands of a market - there are no quick/pragmatic solutions just to make things work.

Haskell is the result of a standardization of 1980's functional languages (1990 - Haskell 1.0)

## Environment

Most popular compiler is Gloriuos Glasgow Haskell Compilation System (GHC). GHCi is the REPL.
